    "body": "Hi folks, thanks for the hard work on this draft! One quick comment:\r\n\r\nIt seems unnecessary to specify a dieterministic *signature* in the construction of `G'`. Wouldn't a MAC be just as good, much more efficient, and far easier to implement? (In particular, it seems to me that the existing security analysis would apply almost seamlessly to any secure MAC.)\r\n\r\nI recognize that using a MAC may be at odds with the HSM use-case, but it seems almost certain that this draft is useful in many settings where an HSM is unavailable. Moreover, since there are effectively no interoperability concerns, it seems like generalizing to allow the more efficient construction is a strict win.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit a PR clarifying this, if you'd like."

Your text assumes that both the PRF and the KDF produce an output of size L.  That's not necessarily the case, even for HKDF, since HKDF produces output of arbitrary size.\r\n\r\nRather than try to address that, I would recommend that you use HKDF more directly unless there is any reason that you need to maintain flexibility."

    "body": "1. First of all, it seems important to state explicitly that such\r\nmeasures as relying on feeding private keys (or signatures created with\r\nthem) to PRNGs can be considered as “last line of defense” only, for\r\ncases when no other entropy sources are available at all.\r\n\r\n2. Secondly, since DSA/ECDSA/EC-RDSA signatures require randomness\r\nthemselves, it seems reasonable to mention that it would be better to\r\ndiscuss keys of deterministic signatures (e.g., RSA, if not to consider\r\nPSS) and RSA signatures regarding the provided construction - not\r\nDSA/ECDSA/EC-RDSA. The signature output is not available to anyone, it’s\r\nonly fed to a PRF, but anyway the usage of signature schemes requiring\r\nrandomness themselves to provide randomness does not seem to be the best\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n3. If an equipment is used in a hostile environment, where side-channel\r\nadversaries should be considered, extra operations with private keys must\r\nbe taken into account when estimating lifetimes of keys.\r\n\r\n4. When a private key is used for such kind of technological signatures,\r\nI’d prefer that the signed data\r\na. would include timestamps and/or counters\r\nb. would include some data that is specific for a particular device – to\r\nprevent the existence of equivalent PRNGs in different devices dealing\r\nwith a single private key (e.g. if one HSM with a server private key is\r\nused from several servers or for the cases of cloned virtual machines).\r\nc. would have some kind of structured form like “This is data signed only\r\nfor the purpose of randomness generations (input parameters = [timestamp],\r\n[counter]).” – so these technical signatures can never be used by any\r\nattacker for other purposes (and to prevent all kinds of signing oracle\r\nhere) – even despite using them only as PRF inputs.\r\n\r\n5. All protocols that exploit this kind of entropy based on long-term\r\nprivate keys should be analyzed specifically together with a specific\r\nsignature scheme, PRF and PRNG – to prevent any influence on security\r\n(e.g. if PRF(KDF(G(x) || Sig(sk, tag)), tag) is used for generation of\r\nrandom values for ECDSA signatures on the key sk, for the cases when G(x)\r\ndegenerates)."
