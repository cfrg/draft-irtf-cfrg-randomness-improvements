             Randomness Improvements for Security Protocols
           draft-sullivan-cfrg-randomness-improvements-latest

Abstract

   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related security
   protocols.  Weak or predictable "cryptographically-strong"
   pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited
   for malicious purposes.  (See the Dual EC random number backdoor for
   a relevant example of this problem.)  This document describes a way
   for security protocol participants to mix their long-term private key
   into the entropy pool from which random values are derived.  This may
   help mitigate problems that stem from broken CSPRNGs.

1.  Introduction

   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related transport
   security protocols.  TLS in particular uses Random Number Generators
   (RNGs) to generate several values: session IDs, ephemeral key shares,
   and ClientHello and ServerHello random values.  RNG failures such as
   the Debian bug described in [DebianBug] can lead to insecure TLS
   connections.  RNGs may also be intentionally weakened to cause harm
   [DualEC].  In such cases where RNGs are poorly implemented or
   insecure, an adversary may be able to predict its output and recover
   secret Diffie-Hellman key shares that protect the connection.

   This document proposes an improvement to randomness generation in
   security protocols inspired by the "NAXOS trick" [NAXOS].
   Specifically, instead of using raw entropy where needed, e.g., in
   generating ephemeral key shares, a party's long-term private key is
   mixed into the entropy pool.  In the NAXOS key exchange protocol, raw
   entropy output x is replaced by H(x, sk), where sk is the sender's
   private key.  Unfortunately, as private keys are often isolated in
   HSMs, direct access to compute H(x, sk) is impossible.  An alternate
   yet functionally equivalent construction is needed.

   The approach described herein replaces the NAXOS hash with a keyed
   hash, or pseudorandom function (PRF), where the key is derived from
   raw entropy output and a private key signature.  Implementations
   SHOULD apply this technique when indirect access to a private key is
   available and CSPRNG randomness guarantees are dubious.

2.  Randomness Wrapper

   Let x be the raw entropy output of a CSPRNG.  When properly
   instantiated, x should be indistinguishable from a random string of
   length |x|. However, as previously discussed, this is not always
   true.  To mitigate this problem, we propose an approach for wrapping
   the CSPRNG output with a construction that artificially injects
   randomness into a value that may be lacking entropy.

   Let PRF(k, m) be a cryptographic pseudorandom function, e.g., HMAC
   [RFC2104], that takes as input a key k of length L and message m and
   produces an output of length M.  For example, when using HMAC with
   SHA256, L and M are 256 bits.  Let Sig(sk, m) be a function that
   computes a signature of message m given private key sk.  Let G be an
   algorithm that generates random numbers from raw entropy, i.e., the
   output of a CSPRNG.  Let tag be a fixed, context-dependent string.
   Let KDF be a key derivation function, e.g., HKDF-Extract [RFC5869],
   that extracts a key of length L suitable for cryptographic use.
   Lastly, let H be a cryptographic hash function that produces output
   of length M.

   The construction is simple: instead of using x when randomness is
   needed, use:

   PRF(KDF(G(x) || H(Sig(sk, tag))), tag)

   Functionally, this computes the PRF of a fixed string (tag) with a
   key derived from the CSPRNG output and signature over the fixed
   string (tag).  See section Section 3 for details about how "tag"
   should be generated.  The PRF behaves like a truly random function
   from 2^L to 2^M assuming the key is selected at random.  Thus, the
   security of this construction depends on secrecy of H(Sig(sk, tag))
   and G(x).  If the signature is leaked, then security reduces to the
   scenario wherein this wrapping construction is not applied.  If G(x)
   is predictable, then security reduces to randomness of H(Sig(sk,
   tag)).

   In systems where signature computations are not cheap, these values
   may be precomputed in anticipation of future randomness requests.
   This is possible since the construction depends solely upon the
   CSPRNG output and private key.

   Sig(sk, tag) MUST NOT be used or exposed beyond its role in this
   computation.  Moreover, Sig MUST be a deterministic signature
   function, e.g., deterministic ECDSA [RFC6979].

3.  Tag Generation

   Tags SHOULD be generated such that they never collide with another
   accessor or owner of the private key.  This can happen if, for
   example, one HSM with a private key is used from several servers, or
   if virtual machines are cloned.

   To mitigate collisions, tag strings SHOULD:

   1.  Include a unique timestamps or counter.

   2.  Include some data that is specific for a particular device, e.g.,
       MAC address.

   3.  Be specific to the protocol in use.  (See Section Section 4 for
       an example string to be used in the context of TLS 1.3.)

4.  Application to TLS

   The PRF randomness wrapper can be applied to any protocol wherein a
   party has a long-term private key and also generates randomness.
   This is true of most TLS servers.  Thus, to apply this construction
   to TLS, one simply replaces the "private" PRNG, i.e., the PRNG that
   generates private values, such as key shares, with:

   HMAC(HKDF-Extract(nil, G(x) || Sig(sk, tag)), tag)

   Moreover, we fix the tag to protocol-specific information as "TLS 1.3
   Additional Entropy" for TLS 1.3.  Older variants use similarly
   constructed strings.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   A security analysis was performed by two authors of this document.
   Generally speaking, security depends on keeping the private key
   secret.  If this secret is compromised, the scheme reduces to the
   scenario wherein the PRF random wrapper was not applied in the first
   place.

   The main reason one might expect the signature to be exposed is via a
   side-channel attack.  It is therefore prudent when implementing this
   construction to take into consideration the extra long-term key
   operation if equipment is used in a hostile environment when such
   considerations are necessary.

   The signature in the construction as well as in the protocol itself
   MUST be deterministic: if the signatures are probabilistic, then with
   weak entropy, our construction does not help and the signatures are
   still vulnerable due to repeat randomness attacks.  In such an
   attack, the adversary could recover the long-term key used in the
   signature.

   Under these conditions, applying this construction should never yield
   worse security guarantees than not applying it.  We believe there is
   always merit in analysing protocols specifically.  However, this
   construction is generic so the analyses of many protocols will still
   hold even if this proposed construction is incorporated.
